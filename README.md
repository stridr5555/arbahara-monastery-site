# Arbahara Monastery of Abuna Hara Dengeel

This static site previews the Arbahara Dallas initiative: a frosted-glass hero, donation/membership forms, and community storytelling. The repo is separate from the Ethiomarketplace work and serves as the content source for the Arbahara Vercel deployment.

## Highlights
- Hero with Zelle donation CTA, membership links, and WhatsApp call buttons.
- Four-section grid covering hero design, donation journey, membership tracker, and timeline.
- Membership and reminder cards with Twilio placeholders.
- Static assets: `index.html` and `styles.css` (custom fonts included via Google Fonts).

## Deployment
1. Use the Vercel project connected to `github.com/stridr5555/arbahara-monastery-site`.
2. Configure the Expo build to treat this as a static site (no output directory necessary).
3. Map your Arbahara custom domain after the first deployment.

## Notes
- Keep this repo separate from the `addis-digital-y0` site and the new `ethiomarketplace` project.
